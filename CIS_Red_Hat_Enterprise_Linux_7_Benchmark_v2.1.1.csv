Overview ,,,
This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration,,,
posture for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 systems running on x86 and x64 platforms. This,,,
document was tested against Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2. ,,,
The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root user.,,,
"Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after",,,
remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify root users path integrity and the,,,
integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in,,,
this benchmark. ,,,
"To obtain the latest version of this guide, please visit .",,,
"If you have questions, comments, or have identified ways to improve this guide, please",,,
write us at feedback@cisecurity.org. ,,,
Intended Audience ,,,
"This benchmark is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists,",,,
"auditors, help desk, and platform deployment personnel who plan to develop, deploy,",,,
"assess, or secure solutions that incorporate Linux on a x86 platform. ",,,
Consensus Guidance ,,,
This benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of subject,,,
matter experts. Consensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of,,,
"backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security",,,
"research, operations, government, and legal. ",,,
Each CIS benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase occurs,,,
"during initial benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts convene",,,
"to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the benchmark. This discussion occurs until",,,
consensus has been reached on benchmark recommendations. The second phase begins,,,
"after the benchmark has been published. During this phase, all feedback provided by the",,,
Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in the,,,
"benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus process, please visit",,,

Recommendations ,,,
1 Initial Setup ,,,
"Items in this section are advised for all systems, but may be difficult or require extensive",,,
preparation after the initial setup of the system. ,,,
1.1 Filesystem Configuration ,,,
Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing,,,
them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables,,,
the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data,,,
can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a,,,
filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for,,,
system operations. ,,,
The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system,,,
"installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be",,,
performed before repartitioning the system. ,,,
"Note: If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data",,,
"has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the",,,
directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old,,,
"partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system",,,
is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data,,,
"to the /tmp directory, this data will still consume space in / once the /tmp filesystem is",,,
mounted unless it is removed first. ,,,
18 | P,a,g,e
1.1.1 Disable unused filesystems ,,,
A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for,,,
unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem,,,
type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure,,,
that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to,,,
unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should,,,
be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not,,,
maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of,,,
"non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them,",,,
especially in light of frequent operating system changes. ,,,
Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of,,,
non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less,,,
attractive. ,,,
Note: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to,,,
consider additions to those listed here for your environment. ,,,

The grub configuration file contains information on boot settings and passwords for,,,,,,,,,
unlocking boot options. The grub configuration is usually located at /boot/grub2/grub.cfg ,,,,,,,,,
and linked as /etc/grub2.conf . ,,,,,,,,,
Rationale: ,,,,,,,,,
Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from,,,,,,,,,
seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot,,,,,,,,,
parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit,,,,,,,,,
them. ,,,,,,,,,

Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter,,,
a password before being able to set command line boot parameters ,,,
Rationale: ,,,
Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized,,,
user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users,,,
from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time). ,,,

Description: ,,,
A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine,,,
why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core,,,
"file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be",,,
overridden by the user. ,,,
Rationale: ,,,
Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core,,,
"dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In",,,
"addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from",,,

Description: ,,,
Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per,,,
"memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute",,,
"(NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help",,,
prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever,,,
"possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on",,,
"32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such",,,
support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature. ,,,
Rationale: ,,,
Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security,,,
of the system. ,,,

3.5 Use File Integrity Tools For Critical System Files ,,,
Use file integrity checking tools to ensure that critical system files (including sensitive,,,
"system and application executables, libraries, and configurations) have not been altered.",,,
The reporting system should: have the ability to account for routine and expected changes;,,,
highlight and alert on unusual or unexpected alterations; show the history of configuration,,,
changes over time and identify who made the change (including the original logged-in,,,
"account in the event of a user ID switch, such as with the su or sudo command). These",,,
integrity checks should identify suspicious system alterations such as: owner and,,,
permissions changes to files or directories; the use of alternate data streams which could,,,

be used to hide malicious activities; and the introduction of extra files into key system,,,
areas (which could indicate malicious payloads left by attackers or additional files,,,
inappropriately added during batch distribution processes). ,,,
1.6 Mandatory Access Control ,,,
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to,,,
processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes,,,
can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the,,,
processes can be reduced. ,,,
Impact: Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a,,,
"system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be",,,
complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring. ,,,
75 | P,a,g,e
1.6.1 Configure SELinux ,,,,
SELinux provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the,,,,
"default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under SELinux, every process and every",,,,
"object (files, sockets, pipes) on the system is assigned a security context, a label that",,,,
includes detailed type information about the object. The kernel allows processes to access,,,,
objects only if that access is explicitly allowed by the policy in effect. The policy defines,,,,
"transitions, so that a user can be allowed to run software, but the software can run under a",,,,
different context than the user's default. This automatically limits the damage that the,,,,
software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any,,,,
"action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions",,,,
must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either,,,,
"one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a",,,,
system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to,,,,
allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Three such policies have,,,,
"been designed for use with RHEL7 and are included with the system: targeted, strict, and",,,,
mls. These are described as follows: ,,,,
 ,"targeted: consists mostly of Type Enforcement (TE) rules, and a small number of",,,
,Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules. Targeted restricts the actions of many,,,
,"types of programs, but leaves interactive users largely unaffected. ",,,
 ,"strict: also uses TE and RBAC rules, but on more programs and more aggressively. ",,,
 ,"mls: implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of",,,
,labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these. ,,,
This section provides guidance for the configuration of the targetedpolicy. ,,,,
Note: This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system. Recommendations for,,,,
"AppArmor are included in the Distribution Independent Linux benchmark, and additional",,,,
Mandatory Access Control systems exist beyond these two. ,,,,

1.7 Warning Banners ,,,
Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist in the prosecution,,,

attackers attempting to target specific exploits at a system. ,,,
84 | P,a,g,e
Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages,,,
"include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system",,,
"is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and",,,
that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the,,,
organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system,,,
"modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific. More",,,
information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at,,,

Description: ,,,
Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter to 1 forces,,,
the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if the,,,

4 Logging and Auditing ,,,
"The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing,",,,
using tools included in most distributions. ,,,
It is recommended that rsyslogbe used for logging (with logwatchproviding,,,
summarization) and auditd be used for auditing (with aureportproviding summarization),,,
to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior. ,,,
"In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended",,,
"that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an",,,
encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that,,,
"may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log",,,
information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the,,,
"local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it",,,
to process the logs described in this section. ,,,
Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems,,,
(particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized,,,
among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol,,,
"for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most",,,
network-ready devices. See the ntpd(8) manual page for more information on configuring,,,
NTP. ,,,
It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and,,,
correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more,,,
significant when compared to an entry in another log. ,,,
"Note on log file permissions: There really isn't a ""one size fits all"" solution to the",,,
permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who,,,
"are in a defined security group, such as ""wheel"" do not have to elevate privileges to root in",,,
"order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have",,,
"group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root.",,,
"Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for",,,
systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to,,,
read the log files (root:root 600). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are,,,
designated as root:securegrp 640where securegrpis the defined security group (in some,,,
cases wheel). ,,,
187 | P,a,g,e
4.1 Configure System Accounting (auditd) ,,,
"System auditing, through auditd, allows system administrators to monitor their systems",,,
"such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd",,,
"will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication",,,
events. Events will be logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log. The recording of these events,,,
will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are,,,
"captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. ",,,
The recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces large,,,
quantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or process,,,
these logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and Workstations.,Note: ,,
"For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64",,,
"bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed. ",,,

Description: ,,,
Record changes to network environment files or system calls. The below parameters,,,
monitor the sethostname (set the systems host name) or setdomainname (set the systems,,,
"domainname) system calls, and write an audit event on system call exit. The other",,,
parameters monitor the /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net files (messages displayed pre-,,,
"login), /etc/hosts (file containing host names and associated IP addresses) and",,,
/etc/sysconfig/network (directory containing network interface scripts and,,,
configurations) files. ,,,
Rationale: ,,,
Monitoring sethostname and setdomainname will identify potential unauthorized changes,,,
to host and domainname of a system. The changing of these names could potentially break,,,
security parameters that are set based on those names. The /etc/hosts file is monitored,,,
for changes in the file that can indicate an unauthorized intruder is trying to change,,,
machine associations with IP addresses and trick users and processes into connecting to,,,
"unintended machines. Monitoring /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is important, as",,,
intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing,,,
information to the intruder. Monitoring /etc/sysconfig/network is important as it can,,,
show if network interfaces or scripts are being modified in a way that can lead to the,,,
machine becoming unavailable or compromised. All audit records will be tagged with the,,,
"identifier ""system-locale."" ",,,

Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount ) system call controls the,,,
mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to,,,
create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user ,,,
Rationale: ,,,
It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While,,,
tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media,,,
may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's,,,
"an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the",,,
"media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also",,,
"have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a",,,
file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair,,,
"indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track",,,
successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the,,,
audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track,,,
data export to media is beyond the scope of this document. ,,,

Description: ,,,,
The syslog-ng utility supports the ability to send logs it gathers to a remote log host or to,,,,
"receive messages from remote hosts, reducing administrative overhead. ",,,,
Rationale: ,,,,
Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker,,,,

Profile Applicability: ,,,
Level 1 - Server ,,,
Level 1 - Workstation ,,,
Description: ,,,
"By default, syslog-ng does not listen for log messages coming in from remote systems. ",,,
Rationale: ,,,
The guidance in the section ensures that remote log hosts are configured to only accept,,,
syslog-ng data from hosts within the specified domain and that those systems that are not,,,
designed to be log hosts do not accept any remote syslog-ng messages. This provides,,,
protection from spoofed log data and ensures that system administrators are reviewing,,,
reasonably complete syslog data in a central location. ,,,
Audit: ,,,
Review the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file and verify the following lines are configured,,,
appropriately on designated log hosts: ,,,
source net{ tcp(); }; ,,,
"destination remote { file(""/var/log/remote/${FULLHOST}-log""); }; ",,,

Profile Applicability: ,,,
Level 1 - Server ,,,

Description: ,,,
The rsyslog and syslog-ng software are recommended replacements to the original,,,
"syslogd daemon which provide improvements over syslogd , such as connection-oriented",,,
"(i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of",,,
log data en route to a central logging server. ,,,
Rationale: ,,,
The security enhancements of rsyslog and syslog-ng such as connection-oriented (i.e.,,,
"TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log",,,
data en route to a central logging server) justify installing and configuring the package. ,,,
Audit: ,,,

# rpm -q rsyslog ,,,
# rpm -q syslog-ng ,,,
Remediation: ,,,
Install rsyslog or syslog-ng using one of the following commands: ,,,
# yum install rsyslog ,,,
# yum install syslog-ng ,,,
Notes: ,,,
The syslog-ng package requires the EPEL7 and Optional repositories be enabled. See,,,

Profile Applicability: ,,,
Level 1 - Server ,,,
Level 1 - Workstation ,,,
Description: ,,,
The system includes the capability of rotating log files regularly to avoid filling up the,,,
system with logs or making the logs unmanageable large. The file,,,
/etc/logrotate.d/syslog is the configuration file used to rotate log files created by,,,
syslog or rsyslog . ,,,
Rationale: ,,,
"By keeping the log files smaller and more manageable, a system administrator can easily",,,
archive these files to another system and spend less time looking through inordinately,,,
large log files. ,,,
Audit: ,,,
Review /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/ * and verify logs are rotated,,,

The INFO parameter specifies that login and logout activity will be logged. ,,,
Rationale: ,,,
SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specifically,,,

This variable limits the types of MAC algorithms that SSH can use during communication. ,,,,
Rationale: ,,,,
MD5 and 96-bit MAC algorithms are considered weak and have been shown to increase,,,,
exploitability in SSH downgrade attacks. Weak algorithms continue to have a great deal of,,,,

5.2.13 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured (Scored) ,,,
Profile Applicability: ,,,
Level 1 - Server ,,,

Description: ,,,
The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of,,,
"ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no",,,
activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax ,,,
"variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval.",,,
When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the,,,
"client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15",,,
"seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated",,,
after 45 seconds of idle time. ,,,
Rationale: ,,,
Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user,,,
access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't,,,
lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening.. ,,,
"While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on",,,

appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is available for needed access. ,,,
Rationale: ,,,
Setting the LoginGraceTime parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful,,,

that their password will expire in a defined number of days. It is recommended that the,,,,
PASS_WARN_AGE parameter be set to 7 or more days. ,,,,
Rationale: ,,,,

Rationale: ,,,
It is important to make sure that accounts that are not being used by regular users are,,,
prevented from being used to provide an interactive shell. By default Red Hat 7 sets the,,,
"password field for these accounts to an invalid string, but it is also recommended that the",,,

5.4.4 Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive (Scored) ,,,
Profile Applicability: ,,,
Level 1 - Server ,,,
Level 1 - Workstation ,,,
Description: ,,,
The default umask determines the permissions of files created by users. The user creating,,,
the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the,,,
chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by,,,
others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting the umask command,,,
"into the standard shell configuration files ( .profile , .bashrc , etc.) in their home",,,
directories. ,,,
Rationale: ,,,
Setting a very secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice,,,
about their file permissions. A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories,,,
created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. A umask of 027 would,,,
"make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask of 022 ",,,
would make files readable by every user on the system. ,,,
Audit: ,,,
Run the following commands and verify all umask lines returned are 027 or more,,,
restrictive. ,,,
"# grep ""^umask"" /etc/bashrc ",,,
umask 027 ,,,

The audit and remediation in this recommendation apply to bash and shell. If other shells,,,
"are supported on the system, it is recommended that their configuration files also are",,,
checked. ,,,
Other methods of setting a default user umask exist however the shell configuration files,,,
are the last run and will override other settings if they exist therefor our recommendation,,,
is to configure in the shell configuration files. If other methods are in use in your,,,
environment they should be audited and the shell configs should be verified to not,,,
